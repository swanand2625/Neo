UNWIND range(1, 10000) AS id
CREATE (:Place {
  name: 'Place_' + id,
  location: point({
    latitude: 8 + rand() * 22,     // Latitude range ~8 to 30
    longitude: 68 + rand() * 30    // Longitude range ~68 to 98

WITH point({latitude: 28.61, longitude: 77.20}) AS targetPoint
MATCH (p:Place)
WHERE point.distance(p.location, targetPoint) < 50000
RETURN p.name, point.distance(p.location, targetPoint) AS dist
ORDER BY dist ASC
LIMIT 10;
ðŸ§¾ 3. Query Places Within 1 km of a Random Place Node
cypher

MATCH (target:Place)
WITH target, target.location AS targetPoint
MATCH (p:Place)
WHERE p <> target AND point.distance(p.location, targetPoint) < 1000
RETURN target.name AS Center, p.name, point.distance(p.location, targetPoint) AS dist
ORDER BY dist ASC
LIMIT 10;
ðŸ§¾ 4. Create 100 Points Near Delhi (Clustered for Testing)
cypher
Copy
Edit
UNWIND range(1, 100) AS id
CREATE (:Place {
  name: 'DelhiNearby_' + id,
  location: point({
    latitude: 28.61 + rand() * 0.02,
    longitude: 77.20 + rand() * 0.02
  })
});
This creates a tight cluster of points near Delhi (within ~2 km radius).
